When CARE runs for the first time, it will automatically download TAR archives for all example input files and place them in this folder.

These can be deleted and re-downloaded at any time.

If you are having trouble downloading automatically, you can download the files manually
and place them in this directory (leave them as archives rather than extracting the contents.) See [the Manual Downloads section of the README](/README.md#manual-downloads) for details.
